==========

Writes text or letters over your current feh wallpaper. By default this does not update .fehrc with the new image so you can try new flashcards.

## Usage:
Get help:
```
$ bash do.sh
```
Set hiragana with a black background:
```
$ bash do.sh -h
```

Set hiragana with provide background:
```
$ bash do.sh -h -b ~/wallpaper.jpg
```

Set hiragana with provided background and size for bigger font to 2 (is a ration of sorts for now).
```
$ bash do.sh -h -b ~/wallpaper.jpg -S 5
```
